## Overview

### Summary
The CV and Job Description Matcher is a tool designed to help job seekers tailor their resumes to specific job descriptions, and assist recruiters in assessing candidate-job fit. The system uses natural language processing (NLP) to analyze and match skills, experiences, and keywords from a candidate’s CV to the requirements in a job description.

### Goals
- Enable users to upload or paste a CV and a job description
- Automatically assess compatibility and relevance
- Highlight matching skills, keywords, and experience
- Provide a compatibility score (0–100)
- Offer suggestions to improve CV relevance

---

## Problem Statement
